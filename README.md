# React Challenge - Pokemon Album

## Introduction

The purpose od this project is for you to learn and improve your React skills. You will work on building and deliver a full React application on your own from scratch. The project is divided into different deliverables, in which you will apply the concepts learned in each mentorship session.

Each deliverable has its own information on what and how we expect you to deliver throughout the mentorship.

## The Project

Create a Pokemon Album, where you can review pokemon cards listed and store your favorite ones on different albums. It should have the following sections:

- Home Page
- Pokemon Lists Page
- Pokemon Details Page
- Search Results Page
- Albums Page
- My albums Page
- Album Details Page

You can use either, a css library or styled components. Design decisions are up to you :)
